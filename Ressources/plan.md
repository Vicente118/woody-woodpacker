# Implementation Plan

## 1. ELF File Parsing (elf_parser.asm)
- Implement functions to read and validate ELF64 files
- Parse ELF header, program headers, and section headers
- Find code segment to encrypt
- Find suitable location to inject decryption stub
- Handle modification of ELF structures

## 2. Encryption Logic (encrypt.asm)
- Implement a strong encryption algorithm (AES, RC4, or a custom algorithm)
- Generate random encryption key
- Encrypt specified code segment
- Store encryption key within the binary in a way the decryption stub can access it

## 3. Decryption Stub (stub.asm)
- Create position-independent code for the decryption routine
- This code will execute at runtime before the original entry point
- It should:
  - Display "....WOODY...." message
  - Find and extract the encryption key
  - Decrypt the encrypted code segment
  - Jump to the original entry point

## 4. Main Program Flow (main.asm)
- Process command line arguments
- Read input ELF file
- Call ELF parsing functions
- Call encryption function
- Inject decryption stub
- Modify entry point to point to the stub
- Write modified binary as "woody"

## 5. Utility Functions (utils.asm)
- File I/O operations
- Memory manipulation
- Error handling
- Random number generation for keys

## Implementation Steps
1. **Set up ELF structures**: Define the ELF64 structures in include/elf64.inc
2. **Basic file handling**: Implement opening, reading, and writing files
3. **ELF parsing**: Create functions to parse ELF headers and segments
4. **Choose encryption algorithm**: Implement your chosen encryption algorithm
5. **Create decryption stub**: Write position-independent decryption code
6. **Modify ELF**: Create logic to inject stub and modify entry point
7. **Testing**: Test on various ELF binaries to ensure functionality

## Key Challenges
1. **Injection point**: Finding suitable space to inject the decryption stub
2. **Position-independent code**: Ensuring the decryption stub works regardless of where it's injected
3. **Memory permissions**: Handling code segment permissions (read/write/execute)
4. **Preserving functionality**: Ensuring the encrypted program runs identically after decryption

## Encryption Algorithms to Consider
1. **XOR with rotating key**: Simple but effective with a long random key
2. **RC4**: Relatively simple to implement in assembly
3. **AES**: More complex but highly secure
4. **TEA (Tiny Encryption Algorithm)**: Compact and effective for this use case

Remember to make your encryption strong enough to be meaningful while ensuring the decryption is efficient when the program runs.
